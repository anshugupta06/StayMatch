# Problem Statement

In urban environments, students and working professionals frequently relocate for education and employment. While accommodation discovery has become easier through digital platforms, **roommate allocation remains largely compatibility-blind**.

Differences in lifestyle habits such as:

- Sleep schedule  
- Cleanliness standards  
- Study habits  
- Noise tolerance  
- Smoking preferences  
- Social behavior  

often lead to conflicts between roommates.

Most existing accommodation platforms focus only on **room availability**, not **lifestyle compatibility**.

This results in:

- Frequent roommate conflicts  
- Reduced productivity  
- Mental stress  
- Financial disagreements  
- Early termination of accommodation agreements  

Therefore, there is a need for a **structured compatibility evaluation system** that predicts lifestyle alignment before roommates are assigned.

---

# Current Solution

Currently, people find roommates using:

- Local brokers
- Social media groups
- Word-of-mouth referrals
- Random hostel allocation
- Rental listing platforms

These methods consider only:

- Vacancy availability
- Gender
- Budget
- Basic preferences

They **do not evaluate lifestyle compatibility**, which leads to conflicts after roommates start living together.
