StayMatch -  An Open-Source Lifestyle Compatibility Engine for Shared Living

✨ Problem Statement

In urban environments, students and working professionals frequently relocate for education and employment. While accommodation discovery has become easier through digital platforms, roommate allocation remains largely unstructured and compatibility-blind. Most existing systems prioritize room availability over lifestyle alignment, resulting in frequent interpersonal conflicts.

Differences in sleep schedules, cleanliness standards, study habits, noise tolerance, smoking preferences, financial expectations, and social behavior often lead to avoidable disputes in shared living spaces. Current methods such as broker-based allocation, social media groups, or random hostel assignments lack any structured compatibility evaluation mechanism.

There is no open-source, configurable framework that evaluates lifestyle compatibility and predicts potential conflict risk before individuals share a room.

This gap results in:

- Increased roommate conflicts

- Reduced productivity and mental well-being

- Financial misunderstandings

- Early termination of accommodation agreements

Therefore, there is a need for a structured, modular, and configurable compatibility evaluation system that can assess lifestyle alignment, predict conflict risk, and assist institutions or co-living providers in making informed roommate allocations.

✨ Current Solution

At present, individuals searching for shared accommodation primarily rely on:

- Local brokers or agents

- Social media groups (WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Marketplace)

- Word-of-mouth referrals

- Random allocation by hostel or PG management

- Rental listing platforms that focus only on property availability

While these approaches help users find available rooms, they do not evaluate interpersonal compatibility between roommates.

Roommate allocation is typically based on:

- Vacancy availability

- Gender

- Budget similarity

- Basic preferences

There is no structured evaluation of lifestyle alignment such as sleep schedules, cleanliness standards, study habits, social behavior, or conflict sensitivity.

Even existing digital rental platforms focus primarily on property discovery rather than compatibility modeling. They do not provide:

- Configurable compatibility scoring

- Conflict risk prediction

- Structured preference comparison

- Pre-roommate agreement mechanisms

As a result, compatibility assessment is informal, subjective, and reactive — often addressed only after conflicts arise.

This highlights the absence of a modular, open-source compatibility framework designed specifically for shared living environments.

✨ Project Goals and Milestones

🎯 General Goals

• To design and implement a modular, open-source lifestyle compatibility engine for structured roommate allocation.

• To develop a configurable compatibility scoring framework that allows adjustable weight parameters.

• To introduce a conflict risk prediction layer based on rule-based compatibility analysis.

• To design a clean and scalable API architecture for integration with hostels, universities, or co-living platforms.

• To provide a digital roommate agreement generation system for structured shared-living commitments.

• To ensure clean documentation, modular codebase, and contribution-friendly open-source structure.

📌 Milestones
Phase 1 – Core Architecture

• Requirement analysis and compatibility parameter definition
• ER diagram and database schema design
• Backend server setup and API structure
• User and accommodation data models

Phase 2 – Compatibility Engine

• Implementation of weighted compatibility scoring
• Development of configurable scoring model (JSON-based weights)
• Match explanation logic
• Conflict risk classification system

Phase 3 – Practical Integration Layer

• Digital roommate agreement generator
• Agreement storage and retrieval
• Frontend integration with match results
• Visual compatibility analytics (Radar chart / risk indicators)

Phase 4 – Refinement & Open Source Readiness

• Code refactoring and modularization
• API documentation
• Contribution guide and setup instructions
• Testing and performance validation
• Final demonstration and deployment

✨ Project Approach

1️⃣ Requirement & Parameter Analysis

Identify measurable lifestyle attributes such as:

- Sleep schedule

- Cleanliness level

- Smoking preference

- Study habits

- Noise tolerance

- Personality type

Define scoring weight structure and compatibility logic.

2️⃣ Modular Database & Architecture Design

• ER diagram creation
• Schema design for Users, Preferences, Accommodations, Agreements
• Clear separation of models, routes, and controllers
• Scalable backend architecture using Node.js + Express
• MongoDB for structured preference storage

Focus: Clean, reusable, modular design.

3️⃣ Compatibility Engine Implementation

• Weighted scoring mechanism
• Configurable weight configuration file
• Score normalization (0–100%)
• Rule-based conflict risk triggers
• Transparent match explanation output

This layer functions independently and can be reused as a framework.

4️⃣ Conflict Prediction Layer

• Classification into Low / Moderate / High Risk
• Rule-based mismatch detection
• Lifestyle gap threshold logic
• Explanation of risk factors

5️⃣ Agreement & Visualization Layer

• Generate digital roommate agreement
• Customizable shared-living rules
• PDF export option
• Radar chart comparison of lifestyle factors
• Visual conflict indicator

6️⃣ Open Source & Documentation Strategy

• MIT license compliance
• Clean repository structure
• README with architecture explanation
• API documentation
• Contribution guide
• Modular folder organization

✨ Project Outcomes

• A fully functional Open-Source Lifestyle Compatibility Engine.

• A configurable roommate matching system that institutions can adapt by modifying weight configurations.

• Transparent compatibility scoring with detailed match explanations.

• Conflict risk prediction before room allocation.

• Digital roommate agreement generation to formalize shared living expectations.

• Visual compatibility analytics for better decision-making.

• Clean modular backend architecture suitable for further extension.

• Contribution-ready open-source repository with proper documentation.

• A deployable and scalable framework for universities and co-living platforms.


✨ Assumptions

• Users provide reasonably accurate preference information.
• Lifestyle parameters are measurable and comparable.
• Institutions may customize weight configuration as per policy.
• The system initially handles a moderate user base.
• Risk classification is rule-based in the current version (no ML dependency).

🔬 Technical Innovation

StayMatch introduces a configurable compatibility engine where scoring weights can be dynamically adjusted without modifying core logic. The system separates compatibility evaluation from application logic, enabling reuse as a standalone framework. Additionally, rule-based conflict risk modeling ensures interpretability and transparency in match evaluation.

## Backend Architecture

The backend of StayMatch follows a modular **Node.js + Express** architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.
